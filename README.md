# HackWeekMobileApp
Creating a mobile app for LifeShare powered by Spectrio residents in React Native.


# Technologies Used
- React Native (obviously)
- NativeBase (some UI components)
- Expo (Command Line Interface, device dev)
- React Native GiftedChat (chat UX)
- React Native Image Viewer (image preview UX)
- React Native Snap Carousel (The card carousel on the user-home page)
- Tired to use React Theme Provider but didn't get it working, we import the themes in every file.


# Start up (terminal)
- $ git clone https://github.com/lifeshare-logan/HackWeekMobileApp.git
  - (need rights from Logan to clone I think.)
- $ npm install
- $ expo start

# Start up (phone)
- download the Expo app from the android or iOS app store
- open the app and make an account?
- scan the QR code the comes up after you run $ expo start in the command line
with your phone to open up your project and bundle it on your phone.

# Making Changes
- Edit your js files, we did yours in atom, and just save the file. It will automatically update your phone's current version.
- We did not figure out how to build the web version or the xCode iOS simulator
version.
